### A little bit of history: Where does this game comes from?
Back in high school, I decided to create a side-project on GameMakerStudio 2 ; a game engine which I only got used to at the time. It was a mess, and the code was disgusting, but it did work, and turned out to be pretty fun!
Now, nearly five years and a developper degree later, I decided to give it a try and finally make a fully playable game, using my past knowledge of coding ethics and design patterns. 
> You can play the original game [on Gamejolt](https://gamejolt.com/games/copsvsninjas/602809) or [itch.io](https://fulgurgames.itch.io/cops-vs-ninjas-old), btw

### So, what now?
I'll try to work on it and update it as much as I can. I remember most of the ideas I got even back then, plus it'd be a very cool challenge for me, and definitely a plus on my CV!
